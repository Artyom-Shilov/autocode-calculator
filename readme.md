### Calculator

In this task, you need to write a simple calculator - a console application that will implement 4 operations: 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with input / output of values and results.

You have to create class Calculator.class and implement interface ICalculator. Also class Calculator.class have to 
set precision for operations in the constructor of the class.

All operations of the calculator must display the result with the specified accuracy precision.

Ex.: if precision is 2, then 10.1 + 6.354 = 16.45

Impossible operations (division by zero of a positive number, division by zero of a negative number, etc.) 
must also be processed correctly.
